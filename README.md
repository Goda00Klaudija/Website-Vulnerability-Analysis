# Vulnerability Testing and Analysis of Educational Institutions within Lithuania

100 websites of lithuanian educational institutions were scanned using security softwares: N-Stalker and Zap Scanner.

The data of each website vulnerabilities were collected, scaled using Min-Max and applied clustering algorithms: DBSCAN, K-Means and Gaussian Mixture.

Silhouette score and Calinski-Harabasz index were used to evaluate the quality of the used clustering algorithms.

The visualization of clusters was done using scatter plot, by reducing the dimensionality of the two datasets using t-SNE and MDS. 

The difference in cluster predictions between two datasets within the use of two security scanners was calculated.
